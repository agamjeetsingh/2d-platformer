# 2D Platformer Engine (C++ / SFML)

A custom **2D physics-based platformer game engine** built in **C++20** with **SFML**.  

Features include a physics engine, an extensible event bus, a flexible callback scheduler, and robust player state management.

## Features
- **Physics Engine**
    - Swept AABB collision detection, impulse-based resolution,
      and positional correction
    - Uses spatial hashing instead of naive pairwise checking for detecting collisions
    - A contacts handler which emits events such as `PlayerLanded` and to which you can efficiently query current and previous frames' physics states 
    - Supports fake platformer physics nuances
- **Event Bus**
    - Ability to emit events and listeners' callbacks being executed by the Event Bus on certain specified safe points in the program.
    - Listener priority system for fine-grained control over game logic
- **Callback Scheduler**
    - Schedule deferred or repeating callbacks
    - Supports cancellation (even from inside callbacks)
- **Player State Management**
    - Unified way to handle all abilities and their complex states
    - Effortlessly handles features such as Coyote Jumping or Jump Buffering
- **Audio and Render Systems**
    - Central audio manager that stores sound buffers and plays them on demand
    - Render class to which you can draw a sprite at will or register a `Drawable` to be drawn each frame

## Controls and Usage

### Basic Controls
- **A/D** - Move left/right
- **Space** - Jump
- **L + WASD** - Dash in 8 directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals)

### Mechanics
- **Dash cooldown** - Resets when touching ground
- **Coyote jumping** - Brief window to jump mid-air after leaving a platform
- **Jump buffering** - Jump input remembered for a few frames even if you cannot jump immediately

## Design Notes
- Chose spatial hashing for collisions leading to O(n) detection instead of O(nÂ²).
- Event bus runs callbacks at specific **safe points** to avoid inconsistent state.
- Unified player ability system making features like Coyote Jumping trivial to implement.

## Future Plans
- Implement a level parser to create a map from a JSON file
- Saving and loading data, such as custom key-binds
- Enemies with AI having natural movements
- Pausing the game, general input buffering, screen shake, freeze frames
- Other UI elements like a pause menu, particle effects, shaders

## Tech Stack
- **C++20**
- **CMake** (build system)
- **SFML** (rendering, input, window management)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++20 compiler (GCC 10+, Clang 10+, or MSVC 2019+)
- CMake 3.31+
- SFML 3.0.1+

### Installing SFML
**macOS (using Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install sfml
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
# Note: Most package managers have older SFML versions
# You may need to build SFML 3.0.1+ from source or use a PPA
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libsfml-dev  # This installs older version
# For SFML 3.0.1+, consider building from source: https://github.com/SFML/SFML
```

**Windows:**
Download SFML 3.0.1+ from https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/

### Build & Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/agamjeetsingh/2d-platformer.git
cd 2d-platformer
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./2d-platformer
```
